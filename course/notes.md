# Classification: Probabilistic Generative Model
## Three Steps
1. Function Set (Model)
    - Probability distribution
2. Goodness of a function
    - Maximum likelihood with mean and covariance
3. Find the best function

## Why Gaussian Distribution?
- It depends, based on human judgement.
- Each distribution has its pros and cons.
- If all dimensions are independent, Naive Bayes Classifier can be an option.
