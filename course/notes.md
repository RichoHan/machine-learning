# Deel Learning
## Steps
Same as previous sessions:
1. Define a set of function (Neural Network in this case)
    - Different from previous sessions, we get to design layers and network structure.
2. Goodness of function
3. Pick the best function (Gradient Descent + Backpropagation)

## Backpropagation
An efficient way to compute partials in neural network.
    - [TensorFlow](http://blog.aloni.org/posts/backprop-with-tensorflow/)

**Activation function**
- e.g. sigmoid function
- Can be replaced by other functions in the future

**Math**
- Chain rule
